# Guide of this project's managing.

I've set up a GitHub project for this repo instead of jira. It will work fine and has everything we need to manage.

To go to project's board. In GitHub open this repo and select projects tab. Or [click here](https://github.com/orgs/kibernetiniu-gudruoliu-bendruomene/projects/2)

In there we have a kanban board with 3 columns. You can click add item and enter all the details about a feature or a bug.

When new item is created it will be created as draft. We should press the 3 dots and choose convert to issue.
Now we can add an even more detailed description, or in bug's case - steps to reproduce

We should convert every todo task to issue, unless it is very minor.

If you want to take a task just:
Click on a task's name and in assignees select yourself.

Now when we have tasks we will have two ways of taking tasks:
1. Reserve it (Reserving is asigning a task to yourself but not moving it to In progress tab).
2. Work on a task (To work on a task move the task to In progress tab).
Note: Reserve a task if you will want to do it. Move a task to In progress only if you are actively working on that task
and have a branch created for that task (More on branches in [here](github.md)).

Make sure to check assignees and don't take tasks that are already reserved or being worked on.

Before moving a task to Done tab, the branch's pull request should be merged.

You can create an issue straight from issues tab.
