# Project Management Guide

Welcome to the project management guide for this repository. We'll be using GitHub's project management features to efficiently track and manage our tasks. Below are the steps and guidelines to effectively utilize this system.

## Accessing the Project Board

1. Open the GitHub repository for this project.
2. Click on the "Projects" tab in the repository's navigation menu.

## Kanban Board Setup

Our project board uses a Kanban-style approach to manage tasks. It consists of these columns:
1. **Bonus todo** - Tasks that are not required for the project to be completed, but would be nice to have.
2. **To Do:** Tasks that are yet to be started.
3. **In Progress:** Tasks that are actively being worked on.
4. **Verification:** Tasks that have been completed and are awaiting review.
5. **Done:** Tasks that have been completed and reviewed.
6. **Idea** Tasks that are not yet ready to be worked on.

## Adding Tasks to the Board

1. To add a new feature or bug to the board, click on "Add item" in the "To Do" column.
2. Fill in all the necessary details about the task.
3. Once added, the task will be in draft mode.
4. To finalize the task, click the three dots on the task card and select "Convert to Issue."
5. Add a more detailed description, and in the case of bugs, provide steps to reproduce the issue.

## Task Assignment

1. All to-do tasks should be converted to issues, unless they are very minor.
2. To take ownership of a task, follow these steps:
    - Click on the task's name.
    - In the "Assignees" section, select yourself from the list.

## Task Progress

1. There are two ways to engage with tasks:
    - **Reserve:** Assign a task to yourself without moving it to the "In Progress" column. This indicates your intention to work on the task.
    - **Work on a Task:** Move a task to the "In Progress" column only when you're actively working on it and have created a dedicated branch for it. More information about creating branches can be found [here](github.md).

2. Prior to moving a task to the "Done" column, ensure that the associated branch's pull request has been successfully merged.

## Creating New Issues

You also have the option to create issues directly from the "Issues" tab.

Following these guidelines will help us effectively manage the project and keep everyone aligned. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask.

Thank you for your dedication to the project's success!
