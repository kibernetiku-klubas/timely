# Project Coding Standards

Welcome to our coding standard guide, designed to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across our project's codebase. Adhering to these standards will help us work together more efficiently and produce high-quality code. Let's dive into the specifics:

## Language and Documentation

- **English Only**: All variables, functions, classes, comments, commits, and documentation must be in English. This ensures a universal understanding and smoother collaboration among team members.

## PHP Code Standards

- **PSR Coding Standard**: We follow the [PHP-FIG PSR coding standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) to maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project. This fosters clarity and readability in the codebase.

## Laravel Best Practices

- **Laravel Guidelines**: Our development practices align with the [Laravel best practices](https://github.com/alexeymezenin/laravel-best-practices), enhancing the maintainability and efficiency of our Laravel-based code. In cases where there's a conflict between Laravel practices and PSR standards, prioritize Laravel's best practices.

## Code Formatting

- **.editorconfig File**: Our codebase adheres to a predefined formatting setup outlined in the `.editorconfig` file. Consistent formatting ensures that code remains organized and easy to comprehend.

## Cleanliness and Maintainability

- **Code Quality**: Every team member is encouraged to contribute their best efforts toward producing clean and maintainable code. Writing code with clarity and maintainability in mind ensures a smoother development process and reduces technical debt.

## Indentation

- **Spaces over Tabs**: To maintain consistency, we use 4 spaces for indentation. Most modern IDEs, including JetBrains, automatically convert tabs to spaces. This choice enhances readability and ensures uniformity across the codebase. [Learn more](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35649925/22113195)

## Version Control Guidelines

- **Effective Version Control**: Follow appropriate branching strategies, use clear commit message conventions, and resolve merge conflicts collaboratively.

## Security Practices

- **Security Awareness**: Implement security best practices, such as avoiding hardcoding sensitive information and using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

## Testing Guidelines

- **Robust Testing**: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code functionality, with a focus on achieving high code coverage.

## Documentation Standards

- **Thorough Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for functions, classes, and significant components. Clear documentation enhances code understanding and collaboration.

## Feedback Mechanism

- **Collaborative Improvement**: We encourage team members to provide feedback and suggest improvements to the coding standards. This ensures a collaborative approach to maintaining high-quality guidelines.

By following these coding standards, we collectively enhance our codebase's quality and maintainability, making collaboration more effective and development more streamlined. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding these standards, feel free to discuss them with the team.

Thank you for your dedication to writing high-quality code!
