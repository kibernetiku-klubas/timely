# Coding standard that everyone MUST use in this project

## !!All variables, functions, classes, comments, commits and docs must be in english.

## Must use PSR coding standard for PHP. [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) 

## Have to follow laravel best practices as shown [here](https://github.com/alexeymezenin/laravel-best-practices).
Laravel best practices (if colliding with PSR) takes priority over PSR.

## .editorconfig file has formatting setup

## It should be in everyone's best effort to keep the code clean and maintainable

## User 4 spaces instead of tabs (most ides including jetbrains already replace tabs with spaces). [Why?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35649925/22113195)
