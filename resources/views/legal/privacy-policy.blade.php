                    <p>
                        <strong>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational
                            and technical security measures.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures
                        designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
                        safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet
                        or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
                        guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
                        defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
                        we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information
                        to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
                        secure environment.
