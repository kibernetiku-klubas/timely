## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security vulnerabilities within our project,
we urge you to responsibly disclose them by following these steps:

    Contact: Email us at security@timely.lt to report the vulnerability. Please provide sufficient information to reproduce the issue, including any potential impact.

    Subject Line: Use a clear and concise subject line for your email, such as "Security Vulnerability Report: [Brief Description]".

    Description: In your email, outline the vulnerability's details, potential impact, and steps to reproduce. If applicable, include relevant code snippets or evidence to illustrate the issue.

    Coordination: If you're willing and able to collaborate, we'd appreciate your assistance in validating fixes and verifying the resolution.

    Public Disclosure: Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will coordinate with you to determine an appropriate timeframe for public disclosure. We aim to release a security advisory along with the fixed version.

Note: By reporting a security vulnerability, you agree that we may publicly credit you for your responsible disclosure,
unless you explicitly request anonymity.
